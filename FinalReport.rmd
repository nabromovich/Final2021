# Introduction

A new  preventative vaccine (covid91) is under test in clinical trials. Given the nature of this vaccine it is suspected that the drug may exhibit different effectiveness across the variety of subpopulations tracked. Consider population subgroups consisting of Males, Females, just the drug users, and just those in the LGBTQ community. Write a complete report that separately considers this drug for each subgroup and your recommendations as to whether people in the subgroup should take the vaccine. Part of the information you need to compute is the so-called effectiveness of the drug for each subgroup of people. Include a 95% confidence interval of the effectiveness for each different subgroup. Structure your report in four sections each devoted to one of the four subgroups, use null and alternative hypothesis statements and correct statistical verbage when referencing p-values in conclusions.

# Males
```{r}
Males <- filter(Covid91,sex=="Man")
```

```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=Males)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=Males, type="percent")

```
  
The box plot above in males that where sick the drug worked for them.  The fact that we are seeing males that took the placebo medication got sick verses the healthy guys that were 50/50 split shows that they drug had a positive effect in the data given. 

### Numerical Summaries  

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~infected + treatment, data=Males)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
  
The numerical data show that 66.9% of people that took the placebo got sick while only 33% of people that took the drug got sick.  This shows that there is a 2:1 spread and show the drug to be effective. 

## Inferential  

```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
Malesmod <- fisher.test(table1)
```
  
According to the Chi-Squared test, the p-value is very low at (2.2e-16).  This number indicates that we need to reject the null hypothesis and that there is a difference between the males that took the placebo and those whom took the drug.

The effectiveness of Covid91 vaccine for males is 67.2%. The confidence interval for males is 63.1 to 71.

```{r}
Maleestimate <- Malesmod$estimate
Malelow <- Malesmod$conf.int[1]
Malehigh <-Malesmod$conf.int[2]
Malelowprob <- Malelow / (1+Malelow)
Maleloweffect <- Malelowprob *100

Malehighprob <- Malehigh / (1+Malelow)
Malehigheffect <- Malehighprob *100

Maleprod <- Maleestimate / (1+Maleestimate)
Maleeffect <- Maleprod * 100

options(digit=1)

# Females
```{r}
Woman <- filter(Covid91, sex=="Woman")
```

```{r}
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=Woman)
barchartGC(~infected + treatment,data=Woman, type="percent")

```
